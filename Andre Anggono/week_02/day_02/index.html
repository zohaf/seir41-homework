					Richard Stallman, in full Richard Matthew Stallman, (born March 16, 1953, New York, New York, U.S.), American computer programmer and free-software
					advocate who founded (1985) the Free Software Foundation.
				</p>
				<p>
					Stallman earned a bachelor’s degree in physics from Harvard University in 1974. In 1971, as a freshman at Harvard, he had begun working at the
					Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (later Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence Lab) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). There he
					wrote the Emacs text editor in the C computer programming language with James Gosling (who later developed Java).
				</p>
				<p>
					In 1983 Stallman began working in his personal time on his GNU Project, or GNU operating system. GNU was intended to be a free version of AT&T’s UNIX,
					and the name GNU was created as a recursive acronym of GNU’s not UNIX. One of the last of the “hackers,” computer programmers who strongly believed in
					freely modifying and sharing computer code, Stallman left MIT in 1984 over concerns about changes to the university’s software copyright rules;
					however, he later returned as a visiting scientist. <a href="about.html"><span class="hlink">Read more...</span></a>
