                        <p>Eich started work at Netscape Communications Corporation in April 1995. Eich originally
                            joined intending to put Scheme "in the browser", but his Netscape superiors insisted that
                            the language's syntax resemble that of Java. As a result, Eich devised a language that had
                            much of the functionality of Scheme, the object-orientation of Self, and the syntax of Java.
                        </p>

                            release schedule, and was called Mocha, but renamed LiveScript in September 1995 and finally
                            named JavaScript in December.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Joel appreciates this because to build a programming language in 10 days, however many bugs
                            and problems, is not only technically impressive. But then to name it
                            <strong><em>JavaScript</em></strong>, piggy backing off of one of the most popular
                            programming languages in the early 1990's, <strong>is a baller move.</strong></p>

                                open-source contributions to the Netscape source code. He served as Mozilla's chief
                                architect. AOL bought Netscape in 1999. After AOL shut down the Netscape browser unit in
                                July 2003, Eich helped spin out the Mozilla Foundation.</p>

                                newly founded Mozilla Corporation, meant to be the Mozilla Foundation's for-profit arm.
                                Eich continued to "own" the Mozilla SpiderMonkey module, its JavaScript engine until he
                                passed on the ownership of it in 2011.</p>

                        <p>In 2014, Mozilla made the decision to appoint Eich as CEO of Mozilla Corporation. The
                            appointment triggered widespread criticism due to Eich's past political donations â€“
                            specifically, a 2008 donation of $1,000 to California Proposition 8, which called for the
                            banning of same-sex marriage in California.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Later, Eich expressed "sorrow for causing pain" and pledged to "work with LGBT communities
                            and allies" at Mozilla. Some of the activists created an online campaign against Eich, with
                            online dating site OkCupid automatically displaying a message to Firefox users with
                            information about Eich's donation, and suggesting that users switch to a different browser
                            <strong>(although giving them a link to continue with Firefox).</strong> After 11 days as
                            Mozilla CEO, Eich resigned over his opposition to same-sex marriage and left the company.

In January 2016, the company released developer versions of its open-source, Chromium-based Brave web browser, which blocks ads and trackers. <strong>Meaning that it's basically Chrome and has exactly the same tool set, yet I'm addicted to Chrome and don't intend on switching.</strong></p>
