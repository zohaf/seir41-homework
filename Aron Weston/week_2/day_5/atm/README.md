# jQuery ATM Machine

- [x] 1.  Keep track of the checking and savings balances somewhere

- [x] 2.  Add functionality so that a user can deposit money into one of the bank accounts.

- [x] 3.  Make sure you are updating the display and manipulating the HTML of the page so a user can see the change.

- [x] 4.  Add functionality so that a user can withdraw money from one of the bank accounts.

- [x] 5.  Make sure you are updating the display and manipulating the HTML of the page so a user can see the change.

- [x] 6.  Make sure the balance in an account can't go negative. If a user tries to withdraw more money than exists in the account, ignore the transaction.

- [x] 7.  When the balance of the bank account is $0 the background of that bank account should be red. It should be gray when there is money in the account.

- [x] 8. What happens when the user wants to withdraw more money from the checking account than is in the account? These accounts have overdraft protection, so if a withdrawal can be covered by the balances in both accounts, take the checking balance down to $0 and take the rest of the withdrawal from the savings account.

- [x] 9. If the withdrawal amount is more than the combined account balance, ignore it.

### Don't forget:
* Make sure there is overdraft protection going both ways.
* Are there ways to refactor your code to make it DRYer?
