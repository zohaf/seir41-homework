    <p class="img1">  “The world of the future will be an even more demanding struggle against the limitations of our intelligence,
      not a comfortable hammock in which we can lie down to be waited upon by our robot slaves.”
    ― <span>Norbert Wiener, The Human Use of Human Beings: Cybernetics and Society</span></p>

    <p class="img2">“Let us remember that the automatic machine is the precise economic equivalent of slave labor. Any labor which competes with slave labor must accept the economic consequences of slave labor.”
    <span>Norbert Weiner, Cybernetics: Or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine</span></p>

    <p class="img3">“Mathematics, which most of us see as the most factual of all sciences, constitutes the most colossal metaphor imaginable, and must be judged, aesthetically as well as intellectually in terms of the success of this metaphor.”
    <span>-Norbert Wiener</span></p>

    <p class="img4">“As to the inventions of printing and of paper, we generally consider these in the wrong oredr, attributing too much importnace to printing and too little to paper.”
    <span>― Norbert Wiener</span></p>

    <p class="img5">“The best material model of a cat is another, or preferably the same, cat.”
    <span>-Norbert Wiener</span></p>
