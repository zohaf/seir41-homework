      <h2>Who the hell is this guy?</h2>
      <p class="body-text">Ok, ok, ok. So. Larry Wall is Amercian (maybe not so important?) as well as the creator of Perl the programming language. This language was created in 1987 is used for high level and multi-purpose tasks, incorporating a number of different programs within its base. It incorporates a number of different families within its structure, such as Perl 5 and 6. Wallâ€™s original intention in creating Perl was as a reporting language that would make report processing that much easier and faster.</p>
      <p class="body-text">Larry is known for his idiosyncratic and thought-provoking approach to programming (and his many "Larry-isms" that have entertained the masses), as well as for his groundbreaking contributions to the culture of free software programming.</p>
      <h3>Fun facts</h3>
      <p class="body-text">The Perl language has been commonly been used for text processing, and to this day (unless I've been mistaken!), Amazon and BBC still use the language on their website (tbh not suprised about Amazon still using it lol).</p>
      <p class="body-text">It's close competitor, Python, seems to be stealing the market so to speak, being easier to learn, though Perl has a quicker execution of the code once written.</p>
