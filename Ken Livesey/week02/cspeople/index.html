        <blockquote>
          Fran Allen's focus has not been on inventing new programming languages or language features and then trying to get people to program using them. Rather, she focused on taking programs as programmers like to write them, and made them run efficiently by doing sophisticated analysis and optimization of the code. She didnâ€™t create paper designs, but a series of working systems that run real programs, not just artificial benchmarks, faster. Today's programming language compilers still rely on techniques that she pioneered.
