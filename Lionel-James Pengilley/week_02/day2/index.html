      <p>
        Marshall McLuhan (1911-1980) was the first major communications theorist
        of how the new media have the power to transform human nature. No matter
        how powerful or persuasive the message, he said, it’s the media that have
        changed our patterns of thought and behaviour. Now, in a world dominated
        by the Internet and social media, McLuhan’s revolutionary ideas are as
        hotly debated as they were in the 1960s, when he became an academic star
        known worldwide for his catchy slogans “the medium is the message,”
        “the global village,” and “hot and cool media.” Today, McLuhan is back
        in the spotlight again, this time as the first seer of cyberspace.
