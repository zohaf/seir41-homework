        "Science is what we understand well enough to explain to a computer; art is everything else."
      </p>
      <h4>― Donald E. Knuth, Things a Computer Scientist Rarely Talks About</h4>

      <p>
        “The best programs are written so that computing machines can perform them quickly and so that human beings can understand them clearly. A programmer is ideally an essayist who works with traditional aesthetic and literary forms as well as mathematical concepts, to communicate the way that an algorithm works and to convince a reader that the results will be correct.”
      </p>
      <h4>― Donald E. Knuth, Selected Papers on Computer Science</h4>

      <p>
        “Beware of bugs in the above code; I have only proved it correct, not tried it.”
      </p>
      <h4>― Donald Knuth</h4>

      <p>
        “Programs are meant to be read by humans and only incidentally for computers to execute.”
      </p>
      <h4>― Donald Knuth</h4>
