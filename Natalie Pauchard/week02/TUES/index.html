  <h2>The Scientist, The Mathematician & The Enigma</h2>
  <h3>Who was Alan Turing?</h3>
  <p>
    Alan Turing was a brilliant mathematician. Born in London in 1912, he studied at both Cambridge and Princeton universities. He was already working part-time for the British Government’s Code and Cypher School before the Second World War broke out. In 1939, Turing took up a full-time role at Bletchley Park in Buckinghamshire – where top secret work was carried out to decipher the military codes used by Germany and its allies.

<h3>What exactly did Alan Turing do during WWII?</h3>

  <p>
    Turing’s work at Bletchley was mainly in cracking <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASfAPOiq_eQ" target="_blank">the ‘Enigma’ code</a>. The Enigma was a type of enciphering machine used by German armed forces to send messages securely. Although Polish mathematicians had worked out how to read Enigma, the Germans increased its security by changing the cipher system daily. This made the task of understanding the code even more difficult. Turing played a key role in inventing – along with fellow code-breaker Gordon Welchman – <a href="https://www.tnmoc.org/bombe#:~:text=The%20Turing%2DWelchman%20Bombe%20machine,during%20the%20Second%20World%20War." target="_blank">a machine known as the Bombe</a>. This device reduced the work of the code-breakers. German Air Force signals were eventually read at Bletchley and the intelligence gained from them was helping the war effort.

<h3>Alan Turing's legacy</h3>

  <p>
    In 1952, Alan Turing was arrested for homosexuality – which was then illegal in Britain. He was found guilty of ‘gross indecency’, but avoided a prison sentence by accepting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_castration#:~:text=Chemical%20castration%20is%20castration%20via,it%20a%20form%20of%20sterilization." target="_blank">chemical castration.</a> In 1954, he was found dead from cyanide poisoning. An inquest ruled that it was suicide. The legacy of Alan Turing’s life and work did not fully come to light until long after his death. His impact on computer science has been widely acknowledged. But the work of Bletchley Park – and Turing’s role there in cracking the Enigma code – was kept secret until the 1970s. The full story was not known until the 1990s. It has been estimated that the efforts of Turing and his fellow code-breakers shortened the war by several years. They saved countless lives and helped to determine the outcome of the conflict.
