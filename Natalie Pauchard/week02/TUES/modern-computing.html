  <h2>Cryptography</h2>
  <h3>The Game</h3>
  <p>
Cryptography is an old game of secrecy with a storied history that millennia later, secures information in the digital age. Encryption, or the conversion of data into another form, plays a critical role in cryptography, with encryption algorithms protecting data on numerous devices across many networks. As many ways as there are to protect information, however, there are also those willing to crack the code. </p>
<h3>Cracking the Code</h3>
<p>
Which brings us to how encryption can be broken. Some answers might be offered by Alan Turing, one of the founders of modern computing. Operator laziness often can introduce patterns or flaws that help cryptanalysis attackers “solve the puzzle.” In The Imitation Game, Helen (one of the decoder Wrens) explains to Turing and his team that each German operator tip-taps messages slightly differently, with one operator using a discernable, repeated pattern. Today, operators still cause problems by failing to patch their systems or improperly store crypto keys.
</p>
<p>
In The Imitation Game, the shared secret was the configuration of the rotors in the Enigma, an electromechanical rotator machine Germans used to encode messages. Once the Allies knew the rotor position, they could decrypt every message. Today, secrets are typically random character blocks, or crypto keys, transmitted and stored digitally. The greater the number of possible values these character blocks can take, the harder to guess the crypto key used to unlock content.
</p>
<p>
Banking, healthcare, government and defense all rely on commercial encryption to safeguard sensitive information. If, or perhaps we might say when, someone develops a scalable, working quantum computer, we might see a “cryptogeddon” with operators suddenly able to read all traffic as easily as British intelligence could read German messages encrypted with Enigma.
</P>
<p>
Perhaps one of the most striking observations from the Enigma story is that after the war, German cryptographers revealed they knew Enigma was breakable, but assumed the Allies would not go to the massive effort of breaking it.
