  <h2>The Scientist, The Mathematician & The Enigma</h2>

    <h3>What did Alan Turing Say?</h3>
    <p>
      Contrary to how Turing is depicted in the film <em>The Imitation Game</em>, Turing actually <b>did</b> believe in working together.
    </p>
  <p>
    <em>“The isolated man does not develop any intellectual power. It is necessary for him to be immersed in an environment of other men, whose techniques he absorbs during the first twenty years of his life. He may then perhaps do a little research of his own and make a very few discoveries which are passed on to other men. From this point of view the search for new techniques must be regarded as carried out by the human community as a whole, rather than by individuals.”</em>
  </p>

<h3>What did <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benedict_Cumberbatch" target="_blank">Benedict Cumberbatch</a> say?</h3>

  <p>
  <em>"I like solving problems, Commander. And Enigma is the most difficult problem in the world...Over one hundred and fifty million million million possible settings."</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>“Enigma is a machine. A very well-designed machine. Our problem is that we’re trying to beat it with men. What if only a machine can defeat another machine?“</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>“Even a broken clock is right twice a day. That’s not progress at all, that’s just blind luck. I’m designing a machine that will allow us to break every message, every day, instantly."</em>
</p>
<p>
<p><em>“Of course machines can’t think “as human beings do.” A machine is different from a human being; hence, it would think differently. The interesting question is, <b>just because something thinks differently from you, does that mean it’s not thinking?</b> ...What does it mean to have different tastes — different preferences — other than to say that our brains work differently? That we think differently from one another? And if we can say that about each another, why can’t we say the same for brains made of copper and steel?</em>
