          <h2>Career</h2>

          <p>During World War II, he developed an analog computer system that could solve differential equations, helping to automatic the Soviet military. After the war, he learned that Western scientists were developing electronic computers in secret and decided to build his own.</p>

          <p>Sergey went on to develop a series of increasingly powerful computers, which you can read about <a href="computers.html">here</a>. From 1953 onwards he was the director of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, which is now named the Lebedev Institute of Precision Mechanics and Computer Engineering (IPMCE).</p>

          <h2>Legacy</h2>
