          <h1>Sergey Lebedev: Computers</h1>

          <p>Sergey Lebedev is admirable because he and his team designed and built a series of Soviet computers without the aid of Western designs. These are some of his most notable computers. </p>

          <h2>The MESM</h2>

          <p>His first computer, the MESM (or Small Electronic Calculating Machine), was completed in 1951 and operated until 1957. It was the first universally programmable electronic computer in the USSR and one of the first in Europe.</p>

          <p>The MESM could perform about 3000 operations per minute, but it was far from small by today's standards taking up 60m<sup>2</sup> of space.</p>

          <h2>The BESM Series</h2>

          <p>The original BESM (or Large Electronic Computing Machine) never went into mass-production, because the  Ministry of Machine Engineering and Instrument-making Industry did not provide enough materials to built its memory system.</p>

          <p>It's successor, the BESM-2, began mass-production in 1958 and was used to calculate satellite orbits and helped the Soviets send a rocket to the surface of the Moon. It was more than twice the size of the MESM at 170m<sup>2</sup> large and could perform 8000 - 10000 operations per minute</p>

          <p>The final computer in the series, BESM-6, went into mass production in 1967. A copy of it can be found at the Science Museum of London.</p>
