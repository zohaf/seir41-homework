          <h1>Computing in the USSR</h1>

          <p>During World War II, the Soviet government was critical of the computing as a field, believing that it dehumanised workers, but they none the less began developing computers to help with the war effort. This is a brief history of computing in the USSR.</p>

          <h2>The Khrushchev Thaw</h2>

          <p>Under Khrushchev, computing was openly embraced by the Soviet government. Having proven its usefulness during the war, computers began to be viewed as the key to building a better society and began to be used to optimise the civilian economy.</p>

          <h2>The Vision of a Soviet Internet</h2>

          <p>In the 1960s, the USSR envisioned the creation of a nation-wide computer network, that would have collected and shared economic data. These plans worried the US government, with the CIA becoming concerned that the USSR would be able to develop an entire computer controlled economy by 1970.</p>

          <h2>The End of Soviet Computing</h2>

          <p>However, competition between the Soviet government's various economic ministries prevented these plans from succeeding. Instead of joining forces, each ministry used a distinct computer system. This lead to creation of excessive amounts of data, which could not be put to good use.</p>
