          <p>Ada Lovelace is believed to be the first computer programmer in history. On June 5, 1833, Ada Lovelace met Charles Babbage, a renowned mathematician at a party. When Babbage began devising a new project, <span>the “Analytical Engine”</span>—sketched out as a hulking machine with thousands of cogwheels that could perform more functions with greater accuracy—Lovelace served as its key interpreter.</p>
          <p>Ada translated a paper about Babbage's machine by a mathematician named Luigi Federico Menabrea. <span>Her translation, along with her notes, was published in 1843.</span> In those notes, she described with clarity how Babbage’s device would work. Just as Joseph-Marie Jacquard’s silk-weaving machine could automatically create images using a chain of punched cards, so too could Babbage’s system—the engine, Lovelace explained, weaved algebraic patterns.</p>
          <p>More than that, she also wrote how it might perform a particular calculation: Note G, as it is known, set out a detailed plan for the punched cards to weave a long sequence of Bernoulli numbers, and is considered to be <span>the first computer program</span>.</p>

        <h3>First Visionary</h3>

          <p>Ada Lovelace was the first to explain <span>the potential for computers outside mathematics</span>. After explaning the operations of Babbage's device, she wrote:</p>
          <p>"The science of operations, as derived from mathematics more especially, is a science of itself, and has its own abstract truth and value...This science constitutes the language through which alone we can adequately express the great facts of the natural world, and those unceasing changes of mutual relationship which, visibly or invisibly, consciously or unconsciously to our immediate physical perceptions, are interminably going on in the agencies of the creation we live amidst."</p>
          <p>Ada has been broadly referred to as <span>'prophet of the computer age'</span>. Those magical visions also coincided with words in her letters with her mother in teenage years:</p>
          <p>"You will not concede me philosophical poetry. Invert the order! Will you give me poetical philosophy, <span>poetical science</span>?"</p>
