         <p class="bio">Ada’s mother, Annabella Byron, was the straight-laced counterpoint to her father, 
             <span>Lord Byron</span>, the Romantic poet, who called his wife the “Princess of Parallelograms.” 
             A month after Ada’s birth, Annabella Byron moved their daughter out of their London house, 
             and away from Lord Byron’s influence. When, shortly before his death, he wrote asking about Ada’s upbringing, 
             Annabella had this to report: “Not devoid of imagination, but is chiefly exercised in connection with her 
             mechanical ingenuity.” This was the best she could hope for, having drilled into Ada a discipline for arithmetic, 
             music, and French, according to the biography “A Female Genius,” by James Essinger, which comes out today. 
             Essinger writes that Lady Byron wished to suppress her daughter’s imagination, which she thought to be 
             “dangerous and potentially destructive and coming from the Byrons.”</p>
